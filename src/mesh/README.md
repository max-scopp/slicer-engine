# Mesh — Triangle Geometry, Loaded and Inspected

This module owns one thing: the in-memory triangle mesh that the rest of the
engine slices. Everything starts with a `Mesh`, and every byte that comes in
from disk — STL, OBJ, 3MF — funnels through here on the way to becoming one.

> _All coordinates are in millimeters. Z is up. There is no other convention._

---

## Why it exists

Three distinct concerns share one truth: a soup of triangles with a bounding
box.

- **The slicer** wants a flat list of triangles to intersect with horizontal
  planes — it doesn't care how they got there.
- **The scene engine** ([../scene/](../scene/)) wants to clone meshes cheaply
  (via `Arc<Mesh>`) and bake transforms once before slicing.
- **The loaders** want a single target type to convert into, regardless of
  whether the source is binary STL, ASCII STL, OBJ, or a ZIP-wrapped 3MF.

`mesh::types::Mesh` is that single target. Loaders fill it; analysis reads it;
transforms produce new copies of it; the slicer consumes it.

    M --> A[mesh::analysis<br/>AABB · volume · area]
    M --> T[mesh::transforms<br/>translate · scale · rotate]
    M --> S[core::slice_mesh]
```

---

## The contract

1. **Coordinates are mm; Z is up.** Loaders convert from whatever the source
   uses (STL `f32`, OBJ unspecified) to `f64` in this convention. Slicing,
   G-code, and the scene engine all assume it.
2. **Transforms are pure.** `translate_mesh`, `scale_mesh`, and friends return
   a new `Mesh`; the input is never mutated. The new mesh's cached `aabb` is
   cleared so it is recomputed on next access.
3. **`Face` carries its own vertex copies.** The triangles are denormalised
   for slicing speed: each `Face` stores its three `Vertex` values inline,
   not indices into `Mesh::vertices`. The `vertices` array exists for AABB
   computation; the slicer reads `faces`.
4. **Loaders never apply transforms.** A loaded mesh is in the file's native
   coordinates. Centering, dropping to floor, rotating — all of that is the
   scene engine's job ([../scene/ops.rs](../scene/ops.rs)).

## Anatomy

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Mesh {
        +vertices: Vec~Vertex~
        +faces: Vec~Face~
        +aabb: Option~AABB~
    }
    class Face {
        +vertices: [Vertex; 3]
        +normal: Option~Vertex~
        +area() f64
    }
    class Vertex {
        +x: f64
        +y: f64
        +z: f64
        +distance_to(other) f64
    }
    class AABB {
        +min: Vertex
        +max: Vertex
        +width() f64
        +depth() f64
        +height() f64
    }
    Mesh "1" *-- "*" Face
    Mesh "1" *-- "*" Vertex
    Mesh "1" o-- "0..1" AABB
    Face *-- "3" Vertex
```

A few things worth knowing:

- **`aabb` is a cache.** It is `None` after construction or after a transform,
  and gets populated lazily by [`analysis::calculate_aabb`](analysis.rs).
- **`Face::normal` is what the file said.** STL ASCII files often record zero
  vectors as normals; in those cases the field is `None` and the slicer
  recomputes orientation from the triangle winding when it needs to.
- **No half-edge / connectivity structure.** This is deliberate — the slicer
  uses Clipper2 to chain segments after intersection, so we never need to
  know which triangles share which edges.

## Analysis functions

`analysis.rs` provides three categories of mesh inspection:

| Function                  | Returns                        | Notes                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `calculate_aabb`          | `AABB`                         | Scans all vertices; panics on empty mesh                   |
| `calculate_volume`        | `Result<f64, String>`          | Divergence-theorem signed sum; returns `Err` if no faces   |
| `calculate_surface_area`  | `f64`                          | Sums `Face::area()` over all triangles                     |
| `compute_coplanar_groups` | `Vec<u32>` (one id per face)   | Union-find over shared edges; see below                    |

### Coplanar face groups

`compute_coplanar_groups(mesh, angle_threshold_deg, vertex_merge_distance_mm)`
assigns every triangle to a coplanar group. Two triangles end up in the same
group when they **share an edge** and their **geometric normals agree** within
`angle_threshold_deg`. The algorithm runs in three phases:

1. **Normal computation.** Each face gets a unit geometric normal (cross
   product, then normalised). Degenerate triangles (zero-length cross product)
   get the zero vector and never merge with anything.

2. **Edge adjacency.** Vertex positions are quantised to a
   `vertex_merge_distance_mm` grid so floating-point near-duplicates collapse
   to the same integer key. Every directed half-edge is then hashed to a
   symmetric key `(min_vert, max_vert)`. Half-edges are sorted by key, giving
   an O(N log N) pass to collect all faces that share each edge.

3. **Union-find merge.** For every set of faces that share an edge, each pair
   is tested: if `dot(normalA, normalB) ≥ cos(threshold)`, the two faces are
   joined. Path-halving and union-by-rank keep the structure nearly flat.

The returned `Vec<u32>` is contiguous — group ids start at 0 and are assigned
in the order the first face of each group is encountered. The WASM bridge
exposes this as `SceneHandle.getFaceGroups(id, angleThresholdDeg)`, which the
UI uses for face-highlight in the `pullToFloor` gizmo mode.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    M[Mesh faces] --> N[Compute unit normals]
    M --> E[Hash half-edges by quantised vertex key]
    N & E --> UF[Union-find: merge adjacent coplanar faces]
    UF --> G[group id per face as u32]
    G -->|WASM getFaceGroups| UI[Viewer face-highlight]
```

**Tuning knobs**

| Parameter                  | Recommended value | Effect                                         |
| -------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `angle_threshold_deg`      | 1.0°              | Larger = merges slightly uneven surfaces       |
| `vertex_merge_distance_mm` | 0.001 mm          | Larger = tolerates worse vertex welding        |

## File-format catalog

| Format | Variant    | Loader                  | Notes                                                 |
| ------ | ---------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| STL    | Binary     | [`io::read_stl`](io.rs) | Via `stl_io`; fastest path, normals usually present   |
| STL    | ASCII      | [`io::read_stl`](io.rs) | Same entry point; `stl_io` auto-detects               |
| OBJ    | Wavefront  | [`io::read_obj`](io.rs) | Via `tobj`; vertex positions only, materials ignored  |
| 3MF    | XML-in-ZIP | [`io::read_3mf`](io.rs) | Custom parse (`zip` + `quick-xml`); first object only |

`SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS` lists the recognised file extensions for CLI / WS
validation. The scene loader ([../scene/loader.rs](../scene/loader.rs))
dispatches on `MeshFormat` rather than re-sniffing extensions.

## Role in the wider system

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User / UI
    participant L as mesh::io / scene::loader
    participant S as scene::SceneState
    participant T as scene::transform
    participant P as core::process_mesh

    U->>L: bytes / path
    L-->>S: Mesh (file coords)
    Note over S: store as Arc~Mesh~<br/>plus Transform
    U->>S: SceneOp (translate, rotate, …)
    S->>S: update Transform
    Note over S,T: at slice time only:
    S->>T: apply_transform(mesh, transform)
    T-->>P: baked Mesh
    P-->>U: SliceLayer / G-code
```

The mesh module never knows about scenes, but the scene module relies on this
contract: cheap `Arc<Mesh>` clones, pure transforms, and a single AABB cache
slot that transforms invalidate.

---

## Lifecycle of a single mesh

1. **Load.** `io::read_*` (or `scene::loader::load_bytes`) parses the file
   into a `Mesh` with `aabb: None`.
2. **Inspect.** `analysis::calculate_aabb`, `calculate_volume`,
   `calculate_surface_area` populate / report basic geometry. The first AABB
   call fills the cache.
3. **Place.** The scene engine wraps the mesh in `Arc<Mesh>` and tracks a
   `Transform` alongside it. The mesh itself is _not_ mutated by scene ops.
4. **Bake.** Just before `core::process_mesh`, `scene::transform::apply_transform`
   produces a new `Mesh` with the transform baked into the vertices, AABB
   cleared.
5. **Slice.** `core::slice_mesh` walks the (now world-space) faces and emits
   `SliceLayer`s.

After step 5 the original `Arc<Mesh>` is still alive and unchanged in
`SceneState` — re-slicing with a different transform reuses it.

## What this module deliberately does _not_ do

- **No placement logic.** Centering, dropping to floor, face alignment — all
  in [../scene/](../scene/). The scene engine is the SSOT for "where is it";
  this module is the SSOT for "what is it".
- **No mesh repair.** Holes, non-manifold edges, flipped normals — out of
  scope. The slicer assumes a watertight, consistently-wound mesh and the
  loaders pass through whatever the file contains.
- **No format conversion.** `read_stl` produces a `Mesh`; there is no
  `write_stl`. Outputs are G-code, not meshes.
- **No connectivity graph.** The slicer doesn't need it; building one would
  cost memory we don't have on wasm32.
