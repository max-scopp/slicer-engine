/**
 * Single public dispatch point for all scene operations.
 *
 * Wraps `SceneEngineService.apply` with a gesture-batching layer:
 *
 * 1. The op is forwarded to the WASM engine **immediately** so real-time
 *    feedback (drag, gizmo movement) is never delayed.
 * 2. A `gestureStart` snapshot is captured before the first op of a gesture.
 * 3. Every op resets a 1-second debounce timer. When the timer fires
 *    (user paused for ≥1 s), the resulting state is pushed to `SceneHistory`.
 *
 * On the very first gesture commit the baseline snapshot is seeded into the
 * history stack so the user can always undo back to the initial state.
 *
 * All callers (viewer, gizmos, panels) should inject and use **this class**
 * instead of calling `SceneEngineService.apply` directly. Initialisation
 * paths (`ready()`, `addMesh()`, `resetWithBed()`) still go directly to
 * `SceneEngineService` since they are not undoable ops.
