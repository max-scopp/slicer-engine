# Viewer — 3D Canvas, Gizmos, and Object Manipulation

The viewer is the single entry point for 3D visualisation. It owns the
Three.js scene, the WebGL render loop, camera controls, and — introduced in
this PR — a full suite of interactive object-manipulation gizmos.

> _Every gesture the user makes becomes a `SceneOp`. The renderer reads the
> result back. It never invents transforms of its own._

---

## Why gizmos live here

Scene placement is owned by the Rust scene engine (compiled to WASM). The
viewer's job is to translate pointer events into the right `SceneOp` and then
reflect the updated state back into Three.js.

Before this PR only orbit/pan/zoom were interactive. Object placement required
clicking toolbar buttons ("center on bed", "drop to floor"). The gizmo layer
adds direct on-canvas manipulation without breaking the SSOT contract: every
drag still ends with a `Rotate`, `Translate`, or `Scale` op dispatched to the
WASM engine; Three.js receives the resulting matrix and mirrors it — nothing
more.

---

## Object-manipulation modes

The `ObjectMode` union defined in `viewer-control.ts` drives what happens when
the user interacts with a selected mesh:

| Mode          | What it shows                                   | What it does on interaction              |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `none`        | No gizmo (default)                              | Clicks select / deselect objects         |
| `translate`   | Three-axis / three-plane translation handles    | Emits `Translate` ops per frame          |
| `rotate`      | Three arc rotation handles                      | Emits `Rotate` ops per frame             |
| `scale`       | Three-axis scale handles (no planar handles)    | Emits `Scale` ops per frame              |
| `pullToFloor` | Face-highlight cursor; no handles on the canvas | Single face-pick → `AlignFaceToFloor` op |

The toolbar (`3d-view-toolbar`) exposes one button per mode in a radio group
that writes to `ViewerControl.objectMode`. The viewer reacts via an Angular
`effect()` and calls `ViewerScene.setObjectMode()`.

```

## GizmoManager

`GizmoManager` (`gizmo.ts`) wraps Three.js
[`TransformControls`](https://threejs.org/docs/#examples/en/controls/TransformControls)
and hides all its mechanical details behind a clean delta-stream interface.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class GizmoManager {
        +onDragStart: () => void
        +onDelta: (GizmoDelta) => void
        +onDragEnd: () => void
        +attach(worldCentroid: Vector3)
        +detach()
        +setMode(mode, centroid)
        +setCentroid(centroid)
        +isDragging() bool
        +isHovering() bool
        +dispose()
    }
    class GizmoDelta {
        <<union>>
        translate: delta [x,y,z]
        rotate: axis [x,y,z] + degrees
        scale: factors [x,y,z]
    }
    GizmoManager --> GizmoDelta : emits via onDelta
```

### Ghost object

`GizmoManager` attaches `TransformControls` to an invisible `Group` (the
"ghost") instead of directly to a scene mesh. The ghost lives at the world
centroid of the current selection and acts purely as a drag surface. At the end
of each frame the ghost is reset to its anchor with identity rotation and unit
scale — so the WASM engine is always the authoritative record of where things
actually are.

### Incremental deltas

`TransformControls` reports absolute transforms of its target object. The
manager converts those to per-frame incremental deltas that map directly to
WASM ops:

- **translate** → position difference from last frame → `Translate { delta }`
- **rotate** → quaternion difference → axis-angle decomposition → `Rotate { axis, degrees }`
- **scale** → ratio of current to last scale → `Scale { factors }`

Zero-magnitude deltas are filtered before dispatch so the WASM pipeline is not
flooded with no-ops.

### Shift-key snapping

While **Shift** is held, each TransformControls instance snaps to a fixed step
defined in `GIZMO_SNAP`:

| Mode      | Snap step  |
| --------- | ---------- |
| translate | 1 mm       |
| rotate    | 15°        |
| scale     | 0.1 (±10%) |

When Shift is released, the snap reverts to continuous free motion (`null`).

### Always-on-top rendering

Gizmo handles are rendered on top of the model so they are never occluded.
Every `Mesh` node in the `TransformControls` helper tree has its material
configured with `depthTest: false`, `depthWrite: false`, `transparent: true`,
and `renderOrder: 999`. This is applied once in `makeControls()` — from that
point `TransformControls` reuses the same materials.

## Pull-to-floor — face picking

`pullToFloor` is a one-shot mode: the user clicks any face on any object and
that face is aligned to the build plate floor (Z = 0) via an
`AlignFaceToFloor` op. The mode exits automatically to `'none'` after the
pick.

### How face picking works

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User (click)
    participant VS as ViewerScene
    participant GM as GizmoManager
    participant W as WASM engine

    U->>VS: pointerdown (pullToFloor mode)
    VS->>GM: raycastFace(raycaster, camera, ndc, meshes)
    GM-->>VS: FacePickResult { objectId, faceIndex }
    VS->>W: AlignFaceToFloor { id, face_index }
    W-->>VS: updated matrix
    VS->>VS: setObjectMode('none')
```

`raycastFace()` runs a Three.js raycaster against all scene meshes and returns
the `selectableId` (the string form of the WASM object id stored in
`userData.selectableId`) and the triangle index of the nearest hit.

### Face-group highlighting

When the cursor enters `pullToFloor` mode, the viewer asks the WASM engine for
coplanar face groups (`SceneEngineService.getFaceGroups`). As the cursor moves,
`raycastFace` identifies the hovered triangle and the viewer highlights all
faces in the same coplanar group — giving the user a clear preview of which
flat face will be aligned to the floor.

The highlight is applied as a per-vertex color buffer attribute on a cloned
`BufferGeometry`. The original geometry is restored when the mode exits.

---

## Coplanar face groups (Rust side)

`src/mesh/analysis.rs::compute_coplanar_groups` is the Rust function that
powers the face-pick highlight. See [src/mesh/README.md](../../../../../src/mesh/README.md)
for the full algorithm description.

The WASM bridge method `SceneHandle.getFaceGroups(id, angleThresholdDeg)` calls
it and returns a `Uint32Array` of group ids (one per triangle). The
`SceneEngineService.getFaceGroups()` wrapper logs the call timing and hands the
array to the viewer.

---

## Interaction priority

When multiple input consumers are active at the same time (orbit, selection
raycaster, gizmo), the viewer applies a clear priority order:

1. **Gizmo dragging in progress** — gizmo owns the pointer; OrbitControls
   and the selection raycaster are both suppressed.
2. **Gizmo hovering** (cursor over a handle, not yet dragging) — the selection
   raycaster is suppressed on this frame so a click registers on the handle,
   not on an underlying mesh.
3. **pullToFloor mode** — selection raycaster is disabled; pointer is entirely
   dedicated to face picking.
4. **Normal mode** — the selection raycaster runs; OrbitControls handles any
   gesture that misses a selectable object.

## Anatomy

The viewer is split into focused files so each concern stays under ~300 lines.

### G-code layer architecture

All G-code geometry is built exclusively inside `GcodeOrchestrator.buildFromHandle()` by
calling the WASM-side `GcodeSource.getLayer()`. Three.js receives finished `Float32Array`
buffers and is responsible only for showing/hiding layer groups and scrubbing segment
draw-ranges. No geometry is constructed in TypeScript.

```mermaid

## What this module deliberately does _not_ do

- **No scene-state ownership.** Transforms are not stored here. The WASM
  `SceneHandle` is the only truth; Three.js matrices are a read-only mirror of
  it.
- **No G-code geometry construction.** `GcodeOrchestrator` never builds
  `BufferGeometry` itself — it only routes the WASM-emitted `Float32Array`
  buffers into Three.js `LineSegments` via `gcode-layer-renderer`.
- **No multi-object gizmo.** When multiple objects are selected, the gizmo
  appears at their collective world centroid but each object receives
  independent `Rotate`/`Translate`/`Scale` ops with the same delta. A unified
  pivot is not implemented for v1.
- **No undo stack.** `onDragEnd` is the hook point for a history layer; the
  viewer itself discards the delta stream when the drag ends.
