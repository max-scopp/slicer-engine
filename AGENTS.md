### Module Organization

```

```

- **lib.rs**: Public library root - re-exports core module and CLI
- **core/**: Core data structures and operations split by concern; `mod.rs` re-exports the public API so all external callers (`crate::core::*`) remain unchanged
- **cli/**: CLI layer providing user-friendly commands and file I/O
- **main.rs**: Application entry point that delegates to CLI layer

### Cross-Platform Strategy

The build script ([build.rs](build.rs)) detects target platform and sets environment variables:

- **Windows**: x86_64-pc-windows-msvc
- **macOS**: x86_64-apple-darwin (Intel), aarch64-apple-darwin (Silicon)
- **WebAssembly**: wasm32-unknown-unknown with wasm-pack

## Development Conventions

### CLI Layer Architecture

The CLI layer uses the **adapter pattern** to bridge the library API to user-friendly commands:

- **Separation of Concerns**: CLI commands in `src/cli/` don't modify core library code
- **Error Handling**: Custom `CliError` type provides user-friendly error messages
- **Output Formatting**: Pluggable formatters support JSON and human-readable outputs
- **File I/O**: Dedicated `io/` submodule handles all file operations with validation
- **Backward Compatibility**: Library API remains unchanged; CLI is purely additive

Example CLI Usage:

```bash
# Slice a model with 0.2mm layer height
slicer-engine slice --input model.stl --layer-height 0.2 --output result.gcode

# Display build information
slicer-engine info --verbose

# Get help on any command
slicer-engine slice --help
```

### Code Style

- Follow [Rust Edition 2021 conventions](https://doc.rust-lang.org/edition-guide/rust-2021/index.html)
- Use `cargo fmt` for formatting (enforced by CI)
- Run `cargo clippy -- -D warnings` before committing
- Write inline tests with `#[cfg(test)]` in the same module

### Performance Priorities

- **Development builds prioritized locally**: Use `cargo build` (debug/opt-level 1) for fast iteration (~5-10s)
  - Release builds with LTO/opt-level 3/codegen-units 1 are reserved for CI/distribution only
  - Profile edge cases with `cargo flamegraph` if performance regressions suspected
- **CI builds**: GitHub Actions builds with `--release` to test final optimized product
- Minimize allocations in hot paths (especially in slicing operations)
- Consider compile-time vs runtime tradeoffs for polygon operations

### Documentation

- Use doc comments (`///`) for public types and functions
- Include usage examples in doc comments for core APIs
- Update [README.md](README.md) for user-facing changes

#### Module READMEs — house style

Long-form module docs (`src/<module>/README.md`) follow the
[Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) **Explanation** quadrant — they discuss what
something is and _why_ it is that way, not how to call every function (that's
what `///` doc comments are for). Reference [src/scene/README.md](src/scene/README.md)
as the canonical example. Conventions:

- **Open with a one-sentence answer to "what does this module exist for?"**
  followed by the single rule or invariant the rest of the doc defends.
- **Lead with motivation, then contract, then anatomy.** Why → rules → shapes
  → catalog → role in the wider system → lifecycle → non-goals.
- **Sprinkle small Mermaid diagrams** where a picture saves a paragraph. Prefer
  several focused diagrams (one `flowchart`, one `classDiagram`, one
  `sequenceDiagram`) over one monster graph. Keep node labels short.
- **Compact tables for catalogs** (ops, variants, flags) — three or four columns
  max; one-line cells.
- **State the non-goals explicitly.** A "what this module deliberately does
  _not_ do" section prevents future drift back into anti-patterns.
- **Plain language over jargon.** Assume a contributor who knows Rust but is
  new to _this_ subsystem. Define a term the first time it appears.
- **End with a "See also" pointing at the source files**, the relevant AGENTS.md
  section, and the originating issue/PR.

### Testing

- Write tests inline with `#[cfg(test)]` modules
- Use `cargo test` to verify release build compatibility
- Test all three platforms: native, WASM, and cross-compilation

## Project Dependencies

| Crate        | Version | Usage                                  |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **clipper2** | 0.5     | Polygon clipping, geometric operations |

_Note: Keep clipper2 dependency current for bug fixes and performance improvements._

## Common Tasks

### Adding a CLI Command

1. Create command module in `src/cli/commands/your_command.rs`
2. Define command struct with `#[derive(Parser)]` from clap
3. Implement command logic using library API adapters
4. Register in `src/cli/commands/mod.rs` and main dispatcher
5. Add error handling with `CliError` conversions
6. Test with `cargo run -- your-command --help`

See [architecture-cli-layer-1.md](plan/architecture-cli-layer-1.md) for detailed implementation phases.

### Adding a New Data Structure

1. Create in appropriate module (usually core.rs)
2. Implement `Debug` and `Clone` traits for inspection and flexibility
3. Add inline tests within `#[cfg(test)]` block
4. Document with `///` doc comments including examples
5. Re-export from lib.rs if part of public API

### Implementing Geometric Operations

1. Leverage Clipper2 API for polygon clipping (avoid reimplementing)
2. Define clear input/output types using SliceLayer or similar structures
3. Write tests covering edge cases (empty paths, degenerate polygons, etc.)
4. Profile performance on large datasets (>10k paths)
5. Document assumptions about coordinate precision

### Cross-Platform Testing

1. Use conditional compilation (`#[cfg(...)]`) for platform-specific code
2. Test locally: `cargo test --release`
3. Test WASM builds with `wasm-pack test --headless --firefox`
4. Verify CI passes all platform targets before merging

## CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions ([.github/workflows/build.yml](.github/workflows/build.yml)) automatically:

- Runs on push and pull requests
- Builds all three platform targets
- Runs linting (clippy) and formatting checks (fmt)
- Executes test suite

**Do not bypass CI checks.** All builds must pass before merge.

## Known Constraints & Pitfalls

- **Clipper2 Coordinate System**: Uses integer-based `Centi` (centimeter precision). Be aware when converting from floating-point models.
- **CLI Framework**: Uses clap v4 for argument parsing. Keep derive macros in sync with command requirements.
- **WASM Memory**: Be mindful of WebAssembly memory limits when processing large 3D models.
- **File I/O in WASM**: CLI file operations require JavaScript bindings; not all features available in WASM target.
- **LTO Compilation**: Release builds are slower due to LTO. Use debug builds during iterative development.
- **Cross-compilation**: Requires appropriate target toolchains installed. CI verifies these work.
- **`apply_single_wall_restrictions` is per-island**: Inner walls are stripped only from the specific island whose top-surface run ends on that layer; other islands on the same layer are untouched. The `pre_strip_infill_regions` snapshot is still taken before this step to guard against future regressions — keep that order.

## Slicing Pipeline — Deep Knowledge

This section records hard-won understanding of how the slicing pipeline works and
why specific design decisions were made. Read this before touching anything in
[src/core/](src/core/) or [src/arachne/mod.rs](src/arachne/mod.rs).

### Pipeline Execution Order

```
slice_mesh()                         — raw mesh → OuterWall contours per layer
generate_arachne_walls()             — replaces OuterWall contours with bead paths
pre_strip_infill_regions computed    — interior regions snapshotted before wall stripping
apply_single_wall_restrictions()     — strips inner walls from first/last layers if configured
interior_regions computed            — per-layer interior (for surfaces), post-strip
generate_top_bottom_surfaces_with_interior()  — top/bottom solid infill within interior
add_infill_to_layers()               — sparse infill using pre-strip regions minus solid regions
```

Order matters critically. Surfaces are computed **after** Arachne walls so that
`calculate_interior_region` sees the correct bead geometry. Infill is computed
**after** surfaces so it can subtract `solid_regions`.

**`pre_strip_infill_regions` must be computed before `apply_single_wall_restrictions`.**
`apply_single_wall_restrictions` now operates **per island**: an outer-wall path P at
layer i has its associated inner walls stripped only when P's footprint has an exposed
top surface AND P does not appear in layer i+1 (the island ends here). The large body
island on the same layer is unaffected. The `pre_strip_infill_regions` snapshot is
still taken before this step as a defensive measure — the snapshot preserves the correct
`walls_per_island` count for every island in case future changes ever re-introduce a
layer-wide strip.

### Arachne Wall Paths — What They Are and Are Not

Arachne emits **centerline paths**, not filled polygons. Each path is a closed
polygon whose vertices are the _center_ of the extrusion bead, not its edge.

- `OuterWall` paths sit at inward depth `d/2` from the raw mesh contour.
- `InnerWall` paths sit at `3d/2`, `5d/2`, … from the outer contour.
- `path_widths[i]` carries the actual extrusion width for variable-width beads.
- For a mesh with holes (donut, hollow cylinder) the **hole boundary** also gets
  an `OuterWall` tag (`is_outer = true` in Arachne, because it is the outermost
  bead of that contour's shrink sequence). There is no separate "hole wall" tag.

Consequence: you **cannot** tell an outer solid contour from a hole contour by
role alone. Use signed area (`path.signed_area()`): CCW (positive) = solid
island, CW (negative) = hole.

### Clipper2 Fill Rules — When to Use Which

| Operation                                                                 | Fill rule  | Why                                                                                                                                    |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Surface detection (intersect/difference of layer perimeters)              | `EvenOdd`  | Mesh slicer does not guarantee consistent winding; EvenOdd is winding-independent                                                      |
| Infill interior subtraction (`difference` of infill area − solid regions) | `Positive` | Infill area from `calculate_interior_region` uses consistent Clipper2 winding; Positive is more predictable for non-overlapping inputs |
| Arachne bead union (old approach, now removed)                            | `NonZero`  | Would require all CCW; don't use unless winding is normalised first                                                                    |

**Do not union Arachne bead paths with `EvenOdd`.** Tightly nested concentric
closed paths under EvenOdd produce alternating in/out bands instead of a single
solid region.

### `perimeter_paths_of` — OuterWall Only

`perimeter_paths_of()` intentionally returns only `OuterWall` paths, even though
layers also have `InnerWall` paths.

**Why**: Surface detection compares adjacent layer geometries with Clipper2
`intersect`/`difference` using `EvenOdd`. If `InnerWall` beads are included,
each bead boundary toggles EvenOdd inside/outside. With e.g. 3 inner walls, the
inter-bead gaps register as alternating "exposed" strips → spurious `BottomSurface`
or `TopSurface` paths appear between the wall beads, indistinguishable from real
surfaces. The `OuterWall` paths alone faithfully represent the solid cross-section
of each island.

### `calculate_interior_region` — How the Infill/Surface Boundary Is Computed

Uses `OuterWall` paths directly as the gross outline of each island (winding
preserved — **do not normalise to CCW**). Deflates inward by:

```
total_inward = (walls_per_island - 0.5) × nozzle_diameter - overlap_distance
```

The `−0.5 × d` term accounts for the fact that `OuterWall` centerlines are
already inset `d/2` from the model surface. Without this correction the interior
region is over-shrunk by half a bead width.

`walls_per_island = ceil(total_wall_bead_count / outer_contour_count)` gives the
number of wall shells per island. This works because Arachne places the same
number of beads on every island (parameters are global, not per-island).

**Do not normalise all wall paths to CCW before the inflate.** Hole boundary
beads have CW winding. Flipping them to CCW makes Clipper2 treat holes as solid
material → infill is generated inside the hole (through the void).

### Infill Boundary vs. Surface Region

`add_infill_to_layers` calls `calculate_interior_region(layer, 0.0, nozzle_diameter_mm)`
(overlap = 0) to get the infill area, then subtracts `layer.solid_regions` with
`FillRule::Positive`.

`generate_top_bottom_surfaces_with_interior` clips surface regions to
`interior_regions[i]` (computed ahead of time with
`calculate_interior_region(layer, infill_overlap_percent, nozzle_diameter_mm)`)
before generating solid infill lines.

Both use `calculate_interior_region` — but with different `overlap_percent`
values. Keep them consistent if the signature changes.

### `generate_rectilinear_infill` — Scanline Even-Odd Fill

The scanline fills cells using an even-odd intersection count (pairs of sorted
X crossings per scan line). This is correct for both simple polygons and for
Clipper2-output `Paths` whose hole sub-paths have CW winding, because the CW
hole adds an extra edge crossing that naturally toggles the parity.

No special handling is needed for holes in the input `Paths` — the algorithm is
correct as-is as long as the input `Paths` has proper Clipper2 winding (CCW
solids, CW holes).

### Infill for Shapes with Holes

For a layer that contains a hole (e.g. a hollow box cross-section), the
`calculate_interior_region` output is a Clipper2 `Paths` with:

- One or more CCW sub-paths (solid ring interior)
- One or more CW sub-paths (the hole voids)

The `inflate` call with a negative delta correctly shrinks the solid ring inward
while simultaneously _growing_ the CW hole outward (toward the ring), preserving
the annular region where infill should go. The scanline in
`generate_rectilinear_infill` then correctly generates lines only inside the
annulus because the hole sub-path's edges produce crossing events that close the
infill within the ring.
