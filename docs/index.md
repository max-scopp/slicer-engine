features:
  - title: Runs entirely in your browser
    details: The web-slicer build compiles the full slicing pipeline — Arachne walls, infill, G-code — to WebAssembly. Drop in an STL, OBJ, or 3MF and get G-code back. No server, no install. Try it at max-scopp.github.io/slicer-engine/.
  - title: One engine, four surfaces
    details: The same Rust core powers the CLI, the WebSocket server, the Angular UI via WebAssembly, and a native Tauri desktop app. No drift, no second source of truth — previews and final output agree by construction.
  - title: Clipper2 under the hood
    details: Battle-tested polygon clipping for surfaces, infill boundaries, and wall offsets — wrapped in a clean Rust API and orchestrated by the slicing pipeline.
  - title: Scene engine SSOT
    details: A unified scene module owns object placement, orientation, and transforms across every surface. CLI flags and UI gestures both translate to the same SceneOp.
  - title: Modern formats & dialects
    details: STL, OBJ, and 3MF in. Marlin- and Klipper-flavored G-code out, with custom start/end blocks and lifecycle markers.
  - title: TOML configuration
    details: Layered slicer.toml — defaults, then user, then project, then CLI flags. Deep-merged, per-object overrides, validated at the boundary.
  - title: Search-first docs
    details: Every page is indexed locally. Hit `/` and start typing.
